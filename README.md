*DISCRIPTION*:I built this interactive e-learning platform using React and React Router, ensuring smooth navigation between course listings and detailed views. The project includes features like progress tracking and video embedding using YouTube links. I referred to YouTube tutorials and study notes for guidance, while CodeBat challenges helped refine the coding logic. To enhance the UI, I incorporated a free background image for better aesthetics.
